title: Continuous Improvement Helped My Team Get Unstuck
description: Training and documentation didn't need to be perfect to be valuable.  But without a manager that prioritizes continuous improvement employees can get fixated on perfection.

I’m a big fan of continuous improvement. I’ve found teams that feel empowered to revisit and improve their work show more ownership and pride in their work, and they’re less likely to get stuck in the trap of perfection.  

A couple of years ago, a few of my team members were regularly pulled into back-and-forth emails and calls with customers who couldn’t access our data.  It wasn’t a good onboarding experience and created bottlenecks in the team, as the knowledge on how to troubleshoot was siloed.   We all knew a better developer experience was possible if we invested in writing documentation.  We decided one of my team members would document the troubleshooting process and common mistakes customers were making, and provide more prescriptive onboarding instructions to reduce mistakes. 

And yet, the documentation wasn’t getting completed and the ad-hoc support continued.  I talked to my engineer in a 1:1 and I found out he felt stuck and overwhelmed - there were a lot of scenarios, and he was worried he would miss something. He was also concerned about getting the document structured in the “right” way.

To get him back on track, I focused on breaking the task down and leveraging continuous improvement to get to the eventual state we both wanted.

- **Time box** the documentation - getting something out this week is better than nothing.  If you limit it just to the information you’ve sent to customers recently via email or notes from recent calls, that’s ok.
- **Progress > Perfection** - initially sharing a draft document as an email attachment is an improvement over the status quo for customers.

I encouraged him to present his document to the team in our next team meeting as well as to do live training on how he would troubleshoot access issues with customers.  We made the following changes as a team to achieve of goals of cross-training and improving the developer experience for customers:

- Everyone began to share the document with customers as a first response
- We confirmed what solution resolved an issue so we could make sure the most frequent solutions were bubbled up to the top, and any solutions customers discovered independently could be added.
- When an issue persisted and a new edge case was discovered the findings were added to the document by any team member involved
- We engaged with our Technical Writing team to polish the initial document and find a home for it in our Developer Documentation.
- We began to link out to the more prescriptive instructions in our getting started email

Within a couple of months, the team was rarely pulled into calls for access issues. Better yet, we had created a culture of continuous improvement and collaboration in the team that we used as we tackled other pain points in the onboarding process.
